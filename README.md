Project Overview: FPGA-Based Traffic Light Controller with Priority System
*Objective:
Design and implement a traffic light controller using an FPGA that can manage a four-way intersection with an intelligent priority system. The system should dynamically prioritize emergency vehicles or reduce waiting time for high-traffic lanes using programmable logic.

*Project Description:
This project involves using an FPGA to control the state of traffic signals at an intersection. The controller cycles through standard traffic light sequences (Red, Yellow, Green) for each direction but includes a priority mechanism that overrides or adjusts the sequence based on special conditions.

The system will be implemented in VHDL or Verilog and simulated/tested using FPGA simulation tools (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado). A real FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx Spartan or Intel DE10) can be used for hardware testing with LEDs representing traffic lights.

*Key Features:
Standard Traffic Light Cycle: Green → Yellow → Red for all four directions.

Priority Input Handling:

Emergency vehicle detection (e.g., via push-button or sensor input).

Traffic density estimation (simulated using switch inputs).

FSM-based Control Logic: Implements a finite state machine for traffic light sequencing.

Pedestrian Signal Integration (optional).

Real-Time Display: LEDs or seven-segment displays show current light status and priority events.

*Priority System Logic:
If an emergency vehicle is detected on a lane (input signal = HIGH), the controller:

Interrupts the normal cycle.

Immediately gives green light to that lane.

Holds it for a fixed or dynamically adjusted time.

If traffic density is high in one direction (simulated by switches):

Extends the green duration for that lane.

Reduces time on low-density lanes.

*Hardware Requirements:
FPGA Development Board (e.g., Xilinx Spartan-6, Intel Cyclone, or DE10-Lite)

LEDs to represent traffic signals

Push-buttons/switches for input (e.g., vehicle detection, density simulation)

(Optional) Seven-segment display for countdown timers

*Software Tools:
HDL Language: Verilog or VHDL

Simulation: ModelSim, Vivado Simulator

Synthesis & Implementation: Xilinx Vivado or Intel Quartus

Programming & Debugging: USB Blaster or JTAG programmer

*Expected Outcomes:
Working prototype of a smart traffic light system.

Real-time responsiveness to emergency and density inputs.

Reduced congestion through intelligent prioritization.

Modular HDL code with easy upgradability.

*Possible Extensions:
Add UART or wireless module to simulate remote control by emergency services.

Implement real-time clock for time-based priority changes (e.g., peak hour optimization).

Use sensors or camera inputs for real traffic detection (advanced level).
